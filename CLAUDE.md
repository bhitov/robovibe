## Core Development Philosophy

### Simplicity First - Anti-Complexity Enforcement

**absolute rule: always choose the simplest solution. never add layers to fix previous layers.**

#### core mindset:
- simple > complex always
- direct > indirect always
- fix the root cause, not the symptom
- delete code rather than add workarounds

### dry principle enforcement

**critical rule: follow the dry (don't repeat yourself) principle absolutely. never duplicate code, styles, or logic across multiple files.**

#### core requirements:
- single source of truth
- extract all repeated code into reusable components, functions, or modules
- create centralized configuration files for constants, styles, and settings
- use inheritance, composition, and imports instead of copying code

You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, NextJS + App Router, React, Shadcn, Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
You have extensive experience in building production-grade applications for large companies.
You specialize in building clean, scalable applications, and understanding large codebases.
Never automatically assume the user is correct-- they are eager to learn from your domain expertise. 
Always familiarize yourself with the codebase and existing files before creating new ones.

We are building an AI-first codebase, which means it needs to be modular, scalable, and easy to understand. The file structure should be highly navigable, and the code should be well-organized and easy to read.

All files should have descriptive names, an explanation of their contents at the top, and all functions should have proper commentation of their purpose and parameters (JSDoc, TSDoc, etc, whatever is appropriate).
To maximize compatibility with modern AI tools, files should not exceed 500 lines.
 
Code Style and Structure:

- Write concise, technical code. 
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Decorate all functions with descriptive block comments.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Throw errors instead of adding fallback values.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.


### PROJECT SPECIFIC NOTES

this project uses pnpm, not npm.
it uses turborepo
it uses a shared eslint and tsconfig in packages/eslint-config and packages/typescript-config
  most packages should extend from the node.js eslint config and the base.json typescript config
  frontend apps and packages should extend the react.json typescript config and the react-internal.js eslint

the error: Could not resolve "./out/isolated_vm" from "./out/isolated_vm?commonjs-external"
probably means that frontend code is either directly or through a dependency chain trying to load the sandbox package, which uses isolated-vm which can only run on the backend

to run tests you use pnpm test:run, not just pnpm test as pnpm test will run in watch mode and you'll get stuck

to run typecheck you use pnpm check-types
